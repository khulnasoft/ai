# Telemetry

<Note type="warning">
  This feature is experimental and may change in the future. Currently, only the
  `generateText` and `streamText` functions support telemetry.
</Note>

The KhulnaSoft AI SDK uses [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) to collect telemetry data.
OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework designed to provide
standardized instrumentation for collecting telemetry data.

## Enabling telemetry

For Next.js applications, please follow the [Next.js OpenTelemetry guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/open-telemetry) to enable telemetry first.

You can then use the `experimental_telemetry` option to enable telemetry on specific function calls while the feature is experimental:

```ts highlight="4"
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4-turbo'),
  prompt: 'Write a short story about a cat.',
  experimental_telemetry: { isEnabled: true },
});
```

The following functions currently support telemetry:

- `generateText`
- `streamText`
- `generateObject`
- `streamObject`
- `embed`
- `embedMany`

## Telemetry Metadata

You can provide a `functionId` to identify the function that the telemetry data is for,
and `metadata` to include additional information in the telemetry data.

```ts highlight="6-10"
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4-turbo'),
  prompt: 'Write a short story about a cat.',
  experimental_telemetry: {
    isEnabled: true,
    functionId: 'my-awesome-function',
    metadata: {
      something: 'custom',
      someOtherThing: 'other-value',
    },
  },
});
```
